# Arrakis Migration Survey
A general survey form used for those who are entering the planet of Arrakis. Travels will fill out their information and select their options the applicable items to submit their responses. 

## Techologies
- HTML5: forms, fieldsets, labels, inputs, and applicable attributes e.g. input types, names, ids, values, and placeholders.
- CSS3: styling all form elements' margins, colors, borders, and font types.

## Future Features
Transform this form into a character creation screen for players to enter Arrakis. The form will be themed as a Spacing Guild's transport request form. Include all the cities, political aliances, and dynamic character photo changes.
